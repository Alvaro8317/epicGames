# Free current Epic Games
## Hi! I created this repository to leave the code of a little little (really little) project that is going to call an API with fetch from the browser, I didn't focus with the CSS or the HTML so please don't be rude with the style of the web ðŸ˜…
The API I could call it thanks to ***rapidapi***, I didn't hide the API key or sensitive information so please don't use my key, you can create one free! You only need to create an account in rapidAPi and search for an API that has in its name *Epic*.

# epicGames
A basic web that is going to call an API and is going to show you the free epic games that are currently in the store.
